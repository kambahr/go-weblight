        Soleares (plural of soleá, pronounced [soleˈa]) is one of the most basic forms or palos of Flamenco music,
        probably originated around Cádiz or Seville in Andalusia, the most southern region of Spain. It is usually
        accompanied by one guitar only, in phrygian mode "por arriba" (fundamental on the 6th string); "Bulerías por
        soleá" is usually played "por medio" (fundamental on the 5th string). Soleares is sometimes called "mother of
        palos" although it is not the oldest one (e.g. siguiriyas is older than soleares) and not even related to every
        other palo (e.g. fandangos family is from a different origin)
